%Section: Bio
\section{Bio}
Ethically-, analytically- and efficiently-minded Mathematician and civil servant with an interest in Data Science and new technology. Thirsty for new knowledge, experience and ideas, I push myself to learn whilst searching out places to apply myself to generate the largest positive impact for society. Driven by automation, data insights and communication, I develop the infrastructure to make my job easier for future generations.

My academic areas of interests are Algebra and Combinatorics with expertise in algebraic graph theory, and a focus on being interdisciplinary. During the course of my PhD I published papers in Probability, Graph Theory, Algebra and Steel making. I undertook projects outside my field focusing on natural language processing, adversarial image classification, logistics, epidemiology and ethics of mathematics. For these I developed skills in Python, Java, SQL and Latex.

Communication is one of my key skills and I always look to develop if further. During my PhD, I gave talks at a variety of universities including: Cambridge, Glasgow, Iceland, Oxford and Warwick. As a teacher, I learned to understand the students' viewpoint and present the information that most aligns with their prospective. As a team member, on multiple projects, I focused on understanding and managing expectations, deciding on minimum viable products and establishing time lines. As a leader in the civil service, I curate relationships, brought stakeholders on board, and set a unified vision.

\begin{tabular}{p{2.25cm}|p{15cm}}
	\textsc{Spring 2019} & European Study Group with Industry -- \textsc{University of Cambridge} \\&\footnotesize{I partook in a weeklong conference where a team of mathematicians and I worked on a problem set by the Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory , UK Government. The question was ``How do you train image classifiers robust against adversarial agents?’’ For comparison, we implemented several approaches from the literature using TensorFlow.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{Winter 2019} & EPSRC-funded Policy Internship -- \textsc{Centre for Science and Policy, University of Cambridge}\\&\footnotesize{I worked on a Natural Language Processing project on the profiles of experts to better enable search methods. These tools are now being used to understand how different areas of policy draw upon the same pool of experts to inform cross governmental cooperation. I accessed CSaP's database, processing data using python (NlTK) and SQL. Please find a depository on my GitHub with code to date.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{Summer 2018}& Droplet size analysis -- \textsc{University of Warwick, Warwick Manufacturing Group}\\&\footnotesize{I used MatLab to analyse the distribution of gas droplet radii within a steel mixing furnace for the paper ``The Effects of Height and Blow Time on Droplet-Size Distributions in the Emulsion Phase of a BOF''. I deployed statistical techniques such as chi-squared to test different fitting distributions.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} 
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{p{2.25cm}|p{15cm}}
	\textsc{Summer 2018} & European Study Group with Industry -- \textsc{University of Bath} \\&\footnotesize{I attended a weeklong conference where a team of mathematicians and I worked on a problem set by Heathrow Airport. The question was ``Is it cost effective to schedule construction work?’’ for this we analysed 5 years of project data provided by Heathrow. We designed a data driven statistical model in Python and trialled out the cost effectiveness of different scheduling strategies. Please find a selection of the code on my GitHub account.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{Summer 2013} & Summer of Student Innovation -- \textsc{JISC, London} \\&\footnotesize{Three peers and I won £5000 to develop a Virtual Learning Environment aimed at enabling non-Maths university students to learn university level Mathematics. The USP of the project was a question generator that used decision trees to understand where students made mistakes. This was called Mimir and the depository is available on my GitHub.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{2012--2013} & Hypochondriapp -- \textsc{University of Warwick, Computer Science department} \\&\footnotesize{Two peers and I programmed an epidemiology modelling Android App with a Java server back end. The server used twitter data to access the density of `illness' within areas of London, then used Transport for London data with a cellular automaton styled model to predict the future spread. Please find the code on my GitHub account.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{}
