\section{Employment History}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{15cm}}
	\textsc{2015--Current} & Postgraduate Teacher -- \textsc{University of Warwick}\\&\footnotesize{I have a wide background in teaching, please see my webpage for an exact listing of jobs. Roles include:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item class teacher at multiple levels (1st year to 4th) of undergraduate mathematics and computer science,
			\item supervising 1st years on a one on five setting,
			\item giving revision lectures to up to 400 attendees, and
			\item one on one sessions with students with special learning difficulties.
		\end{itemize} 
	Teaching has one of the richest forms of personal and professional development I have experienced. Learning how different people think and view problems has given me countless insights into how people behave when challenged. One highlight of my teaching was the year one course in Analysis, the first exposure undergraduates get to rigorous mathematics which normally really excites the students to learn more. The course is quite challenging conceptually, so overcoming these hurdles with students is incredibly rewarding.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{2014--Current} & Assorted short roles -- \textsc{University of Warwick, Mathematics department}\\&\footnotesize{I have carried out various short roles for the Mathematics department. I helped run open days, organising a team of other workers. I worked as a videographer for multiple conferences at Warwick, recording, editing and gaining permission to use talks given at the university. I have invigilated and marked exams, in one instance covering for an ill Academic as the sole marker.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{2009--2011}& Team member / Retail supervisor -- \textsc{Odeon Cinemas}, Bath\\&\footnotesize{During sixth form, I worked in a large team responsible for the operations of a cinema. Within my first year I was promoted to a retail supervisor in charge of the customer retail team and managing stock level. }\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
\end{tabular}

\section{Academic Roles}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{15cm}}
	\textsc{2016--Current}& Diversity Committee -- \textsc{University of Warwick, Mathematics department}\\&\footnotesize{I am a member of the diversity committee as a Postgraduate representative. I have contributed to the successful submission for a Bronze Athena Swan award for the Mathematics department in 2017, based on an assessment of gender equality metrics.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{2016--2017}& Postgraduate Seminar Organiser -- \textsc{University of Warwick, Mathematics department}\\&\footnotesize{I organised the Postgraduate Seminar for this Academic year, which entailed a years’ worth of talks as well as postgraduate talks for two open days. This developed my organisation skills, and gave me experience of acting under time pressure when speakers pulled out.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{2014--Current} & Academic working visits \\&\footnotesize{I have visited and worked with academics at various institutions in the Czech Republic, Iceland and UK, learning to work with different teams in a variety of environments.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{2013--Current} & Conferences \\&\footnotesize{I have enjoyed attending conferences in various countries. Communicating and learning mathematics with people from different backgrounds has enhanced my PhD experience. A highlight was attending the European Study Group with Industry conference in 2018, where I worked with a team of Mathematicians on a scheduling problem provided by Heathrow Airport. Applying mathematics to real world data was of particular interest; this project is still ongoing.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{15cm}}
	\textsc{2012--Current} & Talks\\&\footnotesize{I have given many talks throughout my academic life. The first conference talk I gave was in 2013 at the Mathematician of Tomorrow conference. A highlight was delivering the Mathematical Colloquium at the University of Iceland in February 2018.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\
	\textsc{2013--14}& Academic Support for Warwick Maths Society -- \textsc{University of Warwick}\\&\footnotesize{I was the Academic Support for Warwick Maths Society where I organised many revision lectures given by others, and myself. I ran weekly drop in sessions, LaTeX support classes, lecture catch up sessions and helped with other activities run by the society such as socials, academic talks and career events. This was a truly enriching experience where I learned to work in a team for the improvement of all students on my course as well as developing my skills in teaching mathematics and helping students with problems.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{2011--current}& Student Staff Liaison Committee (Chair 2013--15 and 2017--18) -- \textsc{University of Warwick}\\&\footnotesize{I am an active member of the Staff and Student Liaison Committee for the Warwick Maths department. I joined in my first year of undergraduate and have been a member since. I was chair from 2013 to 2015 then joint chair from 2017 to 2018. Here I honed my communication and conflict resolution skills when discussing problems people were facing and presenting them to the department in a constructive manner. As a part of this role I am an attendee on the departmental teaching committee, where we trialed open book exams and started reorganizing the second year of the undergraduate degree. I attend the science faculty meeting where we are trying to install a unified well-being initiative in all our PhD programs.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

\section{Awards and Grants}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{15cm}}
	\textsc{2016--17}& Mathematics Institute Postgraduate Teaching Prize -- \textsc{University of Warwick}\\&\footnotesize{``These are awarded to supervisors/TAs by vote of the undergraduates, so are earned through the genuine appreciation of people you taught in 2016-17.”}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{2015--Current}& Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Doctoral Award -- \textsc{University of Warwick}\\&\footnotesize{Funding to undertake a PhD in Mathematics at the University of Warwick.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

\section{Publications and Preprints}
\footnotesize{I have worked on four papers to date, three are in different stages of the publishing process in pure mathematics and detailed below. A work in progress, not listed below, is in an applied area where we study bubbles forming in a mixing process to form steel. My main work was statistical analysis on experimental data, using Matlab on large scale data. I learned to communicate mathematics to non-specialist as well as adjusting to a situation in which I was unfamiliar.}
