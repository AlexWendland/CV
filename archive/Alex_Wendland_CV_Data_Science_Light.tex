\section{Personal Statement}
Analytically-, efficiently- and ethically-minded mathematician and civil servant with an interest in Data Science and new technology. Thirsty for new knowledge, experience and ideas, I push myself to learn whilst searching out places to apply myself to generate the largest positive impact. Driven by automation, data insights and communication, I enjoy developing infrastructure to make jobs easier and more efficient.

\section{Employment History}
\begin{tabular}{p{2.25cm}|p{15cm}}
	\textsc{2020--Current} & UK Civil Servant -- \textsc{Science and Engineering Fast Stream, Cabinet Office London}\\&\footnotesize{The \href{https://www.faststream.gov.uk/}{Fast Stream} is a competitive three-year leadership programme focusing on developing individuals communication, organisational and leadership skills. Within the \href{https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-council-on-the-misuse-of-drugs}{Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs} I project managed multiple high profile technical reports with multiple stakeholders. I understood the wants of lay policy officials whilst quickly learning a new field from experts, all the while guiding the experts to provide relevant insights and keeping the policy officials on board with my vision for the project.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{2015--2020} & Postgraduate Teacher -- \textsc{University of Warwick}\\&\footnotesize{I have taught in all levels and formats: lecturing masters level courses to helping underprivileged A-Level students. I use my emotional intelligence to understand the perspective of the student, my analytical mind set to break this problem down, and excellent verbal and written communication skills to convey enough information so the student can discover the solution themselves. For this I won a student voted prize in 2017.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{}

	Working Knowledge: & Matlab, \textsc{MAGMA}, C, SQL, Excel/Google sheets, VBA, and JavaScript\\
\end{tabular}\\
\vspace{0.1 in}\\
\begin{tabular}{p{2.25cm}|p{15cm}}
	\textsc{Current}  & Automation, Mathematical Techniques -- \textsc{UK Civil Service, London} \\&\footnotesize{Within my role in the civil service I seek out ways to automate as many processes (using Google sheets with java Script) as possible whilst building data infrastructure for the future. I used mathematical tools such as perfect matchings, linear programming and Natural Language processing with my programming expertise to automate networking opportunities, candidate to role matching and management practices to improve overall efficiency.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{Spring 2019} & Adversarial Image Classification, Machine Learning -- \textsc{ESGI, University of Cambridge} \\&\footnotesize{Collaboratively worked in a team of industrialists and academics on a question by the UK \href{https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory}{Defense, Science and Technology Laboratory}: "How do you train image classifiers robust against adversarial agents?" We identified risks with current Machine learning methods and we implemented several approaches from the literature using TensorFlow to see how to mitigate these. This report can be provided upon request.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{Winter 2019} & Natural Language Processing, Data Manipulation -- \textsc{CSaP, University of Cambridge}\\&\footnotesize{I taught myself Natural Language Processing (using NLTK within python) to match policy makers to academic experts using the \href{https://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/}{Centre for Science and Policy}'s database. I accessed CSaP's database using SQL and manipulated the data with python (using Pandas and numpy) developing them an end product still used by the team today.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{Summer 2018}& Distribution Fitting, Statistical Tests -- \textsc{Warwick Manufacturing Group, University of Warwick}\\&\footnotesize{Working in an interdisciplinary team I used MatLab to do probability distribution fitting and hypothesis testing (using chi-squared) to determine a best fitting distribution for the gas droplet radii within a steel mixing furnace. This work is in the process of being published.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{Summer 2018} & Statistical Modelling, Data Analysis -- \textsc{ESGI, University of Bath} \\&\footnotesize{Consulting with Heathrow Airport I worked in a team of academics to answer the question ``Is it cost effective to schedule construction work?’’. Using 5 years of project data we developed a stochastic model in Python and trialled out the cost effectiveness of different scheduling strategies. Please find a selection of the code on my GitHub account.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{p{2.25cm}|p{15cm}}
	\textsc{Summer 2013} & Web Development, Mathematical Education -- \textsc{JISC, London} \\&\footnotesize{In a cross-discipline team of students we competed and won £5000 to develop a Virtual Learning Environment using python (Django). We automated question generation and using decisions trees built an error correction system. This was called Mimir and the depository is available on my GitHub.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	\textsc{2012--2013} & Statistical Modelling, Data Mining -- \textsc{University of Warwick, Computer Science department} \\&\footnotesize{In a team of peers we developed an epidemiology modelling Android App with a Java server back end. The server used twitter data to access the density of `illness' within areas of London, then used Transport for London data with a cellular automaton styled model to predict the future spread. Please find the code on my GitHub account.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{}
